Summary 
Over the past six months, the coffee shop has shown steady revenue growth, with peak sales during weekday mornings and strong performance from products like Barista Espresso and brewed chai tea. Monthly revenue rose from 98,835 in March to 166,485 in June, with an increased average order value when specialty coffee was paired with bakery items, reaching a high of 35,353 in June. Challenges include a sales dip in mid-afternoon, presenting an opportunity for targeted promotions. Recommendations include introducing off-peak discounts and "Buy One Get One Free" offers for underperforming items like coffee beans and packaged products to boost sales.
